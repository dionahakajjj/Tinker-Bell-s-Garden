# 🌸 Tinker Bell’s Garden

Course Project: Web Design and Development – UBT
Tinker Bell’s Garden is a front-end web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, serving as a virtual flower shop. The project is developed based on the course requirements and includes multiple functional pages, JavaScript validations, a clean project structure, and version control using Git & GitHub.
The website presents different types of flowers, information about the shop, the buying process, and a detailed page for each product. The design is clean, modern, and adapted from the visual concept created in Figma.

# 🎯 Project Objective
Build a functional website with a minimum of 3–5 main pages.
Apply HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript best practices.
Validate forms using plain JavaScript or optionally a library such as jQuery/Validate.js.
Implement Login and Register pages with validations.
Ensure a well-organized project structure following front-end best practices.
Use Git for every added feature in the project.
Create a responsive version (for the final submission).
